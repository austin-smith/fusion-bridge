# Alarm & Area System Overhaul - Migration Status

## 🎯 Project Overview

This document tracks the progress of splitting the legacy "Areas" system into two distinct concepts:
- **Spaces**: Physical locations where devices coexist (one device per space)
- **Alarm Zones**: Logical security groupings (devices can belong to multiple zones)

The goal is to eliminate the conceptual confusion where "areas" tried to represent both physical proximity AND alarm groupings.

## ✅ **COMPLETED PHASES (1-8)**

### Phase 1: Database & Core Models ✅
- ✅ New database tables created: `spaces`, `spaceDevices`, `alarmZones`, `alarmZoneDevices`, `alarmZoneTriggerOverrides`, `alarmZoneAuditLog`
- ✅ TypeScript types defined for all new entities in `src/types/index.ts`
- ✅ Organization-scoped database access patterns established in `src/lib/db/org-scoped-db.ts`
- ✅ Repository functions implemented for spaces and alarm zones

### Phase 2: Space Management ✅
- ✅ Complete API routes: `/api/spaces`, `/api/spaces/[id]/devices`
- ✅ One-space-per-device constraint enforced via database PRIMARY KEY
- ✅ Zustand store integration for space management (`src/stores/store.ts`)
- ✅ Camera association logic updated to use spaces instead of areas

### Phase 3: Alarm Zone Core ✅
- ✅ Complete API routes: `/api/alarm-zones`, `/api/alarm-zones/[id]/*`
- ✅ Zone-based arming/disarming logic implemented

## 🏗️ **ARCHITECTURAL DECISIONS MADE**

### Key Design Choices
1. **One Device = One Space**: Enforced via database constraint, devices cannot be in multiple physical locations
2. **Location-Scoped Zones**: Alarm zones belong to specific locations, not organization-wide
3. **Efficient Trigger Logic**: Most zones use 'standard' behavior (predefined event list), avoiding database lookups
4. **No Automated Migration**: Legacy area data must be manually transferred if needed
5. **Audit Everything**: All alarm zone state changes are logged with user context
6. **Enhanced Event Processing**: Redis messages now include alarm zone information for real-time processing

### Database Schema Highlights
- `spaceDevices.deviceId` has PRIMARY KEY constraint (one space per device)
- `alarmZones.locationId` ensures location-specific security zones
- `alarmZoneTriggerOverrides` only used for 'custom' trigger behavior
- Efficient indexing on audit log for performance
- Alarm zone device lookups optimized for event processing

### Performance Considerations
- In-memory ALARM_EVENT_TYPES checking for standard zones
- Indexed database queries for custom trigger rules
- DISARMED zones skip all trigger evaluation
- Optimized device queries with proper joins
- Efficient alarm zone lookup in event processing pipeline

## 🔧 **TECHNICAL NOTES FOR NEXT AGENT**

### Critical Files Modified
- `src/lib/db/org-scoped-db.ts` - Updated all device queries to include space information
- `src/services/event-thumbnail-resolver.ts` - Changed from area-based to space-based camera associations  
- `src/lib/events/eventProcessor.ts` - Updated to use space cameras and alarm zone information
- `src/lib/redis/types.ts` - Enhanced with alarm zone fields, removed area fields
- `src/types/index.ts` - Added all new space/alarm zone types
- `src/stores/store.ts` - Added complete state management for spaces and alarm zones, removed all area code

### Zustand Store State
The store now includes:
```typescript
// Spaces
spaces: Space[]
isLoadingSpaces: boolean
errorSpaces: string | null

// Alarm Zones  
alarmZones: AlarmZone[]
isLoadingAlarmZones: boolean
errorAlarmZones: string | null
```

### API Endpoints Available
- `GET/POST /api/spaces` - Space CRUD
- `GET/POST /api/spaces/[id]/devices` - Device assignment
- `GET/POST /api/alarm-zones` - Zone CRUD  
- `PATCH /api/alarm-zones/[id]` - Zone updates including arm state
- `GET/POST /api/alarm-zones/[id]/devices` - Zone device assignment

## ⚠️ **WARNINGS & CAUTIONS**

1. **Backward Compatibility**: NO automated migration provided - legacy area data will be lost unless manually transferred

2. **Database Constraints**: The one-device-per-space constraint is enforced at database level - be careful with bulk device operations

3. **Event Processing**: Event processor has been updated to use spaces and alarm zones - all area references completely removed

4. **Testing**: The user prefers not to add test automation, so manual testing is critical during automation system updates
